<div class="testimonial">
			<div class="quote">"My experience working alongside Patrícia over the past year has been nothing short of exceptional.
From the moment she entered our company, there has been a noticeable change in organization and interdepartmental communication.
Patricia is someone on whom one can rely on, as there is an openness to communicate and a sense of accomplishment after each meeting.
I have experienced many meetings where the general feeling is that not much is achieved, but never with Patricia. She can always drive a crucial point home and set feasible goals to agilize processes and motivate the team.
In my opinion, every company should have its own version of Patrícia - someone who listens, understands and solves."</div>

			<div class="quote">"I highly recommend Patricia, who I worked with at Data Leaders for over 2 years. During this time, I was impressed by Patricia's dedication, initiative, and willingness to go above and beyond to help the team.

Patricia demonstrated a strong work ethic and a genuine interest in learning the job. She actively built and expanded her skill set, learning new skills and tools to help her effectively manage projects.

One of the things that stood out to me about Patricia was her ability to go the extra length to help people on the project. She was always willing to lend a hand, even when it meant taking on extra work or unblocking people when there were obstacles. Her positive attitude and team spirit made her a pleasure to work with.

Overall, I highly recommend Patricia for any future opportunities in product management. She proved to be a valuable asset to the team, and I am confident she will continue to do very well in her career."</div>

		<div class="testimonial">
			<div class="quote">"Patricia has demonstrated an excellent attitude ever since I have worked with her. Her continuous helpfulness has been integral in improving all the functions within the organisation. She has, despite many set backs finalised a very tricky website which has involved her working beyond her given hours, and the end result was higher than all expectations. Showing a huge appetite in moving the company forward has meant Patricia has been involved with work outside of her remit and she has miraculously been able to balance and exceed in all possible ways."</div>

		<div class="testimonial">
			<div class="quote">"In a recent academic project (“UCC online”) that Patrícia has developed and that was supervised by me, I was able to confirm her specific skills, namely
regarding her ability to meet the costumer’s needs and to meet deadlines as well as her constant concern about the quality of the final product and her realistic task and time management. Its was a challenge to work with different
stakeholders and this student has revealed her capacity to work under pressure and to develop a goal oriented work."</div>
